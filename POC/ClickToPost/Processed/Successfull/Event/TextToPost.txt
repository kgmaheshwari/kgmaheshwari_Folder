Bright Spark - Let's educate India.

Bright Spark is an out-of-school time program that attempts to address educational inequity by working with underserved learners who are enrolled in low-cost private schools or government schools.
Most of these are underserved learners who struggle with basic literacy and numeracy skills.

We focus on building foundational literacy and math & logical reasoning skills through child-centric, activity-based learning that is relevant to the child's life and socio-cultural environment.

While looking at building academic and cognitive skills, we focus on the child's social and emotional well-being.
